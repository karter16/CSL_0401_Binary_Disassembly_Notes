**Reference Documents**  
Below are details of the reference documents provided:

[CPU32RM.pdf](https://github.com/karter16/CSL_0401_Binary_Disassembly_Notes/blob/master/CPU32RM.pdf): This is the reference document for the CPU32 architecture that the MSS54HP processors are based on. Useful for referencing instructions, etc.
  
[MC68376.pdf](https://github.com/karter16/CSL_0401_Binary_Disassembly_Notes/blob/master/MC68376.pdf): This is the Motorola reference document for the MC68336/376 processors. As far as I can tell the MSS54HP uses the MC68336 or a very similar variant of it.
  
[Siemens_MSS54_Funktionsrahmen_Deutsch.pdf](https://github.com/karter16/CSL_0401_Binary_Disassembly_Notes/blob/master/Siemens_MSS54_Funktionsrahmen_Deutsch.pdf): This is a copy of the document that is floating around the internet. In the original German for reference as Google's ML translation is less than great in places.
